# CosmologicalSimulationsPlan
Cosmological Simulations Plan and Needs Assessment


This report will define the cosmological simulations plan, computing needs and personnel resources

- An overview of the key simulations, based on the SRM (key characteristics and delivery timescale) for DC1,2,3
  - simulation generation (DM and hydro)
  - catalog development
  - infrastructure to handle and manipulate simulations
- The resources to meet those needs given timeline (indicating which are secured and which are yet to be secured)
  - current simulations/catalogs that are to be used in the near term
  - HPC resources needed for simulation generation (those in place and those to be secured)
  - Personnel effort for sim, catalog and infrastructure development and testing work
  - Names of those who are responsible for delivering each major simulations deliverable (definiteness key for FY17 and FY18 and then can be more fluid in FY19).

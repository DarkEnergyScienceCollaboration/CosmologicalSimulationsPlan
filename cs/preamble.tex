\subsection{Introduction}
\label{sec:preamble:introduction}

This report will define the cosmological simulations plan, computing needs and personnel resources

\begin{itemize}
   \item    An overview of the key simulations, based on the SRM (key characteristics and delivery timescale) for DC1,2,3
     \begin{itemize}
        \item        simulation generation (DM and hydro)
        \item        catalog development
        \item        infrastructure to handle and manipulate simulations
     \end{itemize}
   \item    The resources to meet those needs given timeline (indicating which are secured and which are yet to be secured)
     \begin{itemize}
        \item        current simulations/catalogs that are to be used in the near term
        \item        HPC resources needed for simulation generation (those in place and those to be secured)
        \item        Personnel effort for sim, catalog and infrastructure development and testing work
        \item        Names of those who are responsible for delivering each major simulations deliverable (definiteness key for FY17 and FY18 and then can be more fluid in FY19).
     \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
